# a099 Simon Says Final Project
**Description** 

The Simon game is a simple memory game in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. Simon will display a sequence and the user adds to the sequence throughout the game and follows the onscreen instructions. Our game uses html for the majority of the frontend framework and JavaScript for the forms as well as connecting the frontend to the database. Lastly SQL is used for our user database that will track user's login information as well as their high scores.
