# API Endpoints

Our API interacts with user by recording their login information and then records their score each time they play the game. The score is compared to the high score, and if the user reaches a new highscore, the new score replaces the highest score.

We used HTTP methods Patch and Post. Patch was used for updating user information and Post was used for setting user information.
